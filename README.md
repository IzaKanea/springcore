# Spring Core
 
 
<h4>Purpose </h4>
 <p>
 This project is a part of my online documentation to keep solutions hand on. Anyone who need it can use it as he wish.
<p/>
<h4>Description : On the way to mastering  Spring</h4>
<p>Through a ApplicationContext as container, I start with the basics. For the configuration part, I use xml files and annotations with class configuration in separate packages.<br />
 
 Find here the annotations used : @Component, @Primary, @Autowired, @Qualifier, @Configuration and @ComponentScan
